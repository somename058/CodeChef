/* In Byteland they have a very strange monetary system.

Each Bytelandian gold coin has an integer number written on it. A coin n can be exchanged in a bank into three coins: n/2, n/3 and n/4. But these numbers are all rounded down (the banks have to make a profit).

You can also sell Bytelandian coins for American dollars. The exchange rate is 1:1. But you can not buy Bytelandian coins.

You have one gold coin. What is the maximum amount of American dollars you can get for it? */
